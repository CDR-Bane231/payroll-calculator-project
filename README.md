Create a Python program that asks the user to enter their salary and the method of payment, whether biweekly or monthly. The program will manipulate that amount to calculate what is withheld from the following items:

- Family Health Insurance (SFS)

- Pension Fund Administrator (AFP)

- Income Tax (ISR)

Also, specify the total withholdings, which is the sum of the SFS, AFP and ISR.

Finally, show the net salary, which is the remainder after all withholdings.

If the user indicated that his payment method is biweekly, the withholdings and the biweekly net salary must be shown.


Explanation

The minimum quotable salary is $16,262.50 pesos.

The amount payable for Family Health Insurance (SFS, for its acronym in Spanish) is equivalent to 3.04% of the employee's monthly salary. Its maximum is limited to $4,742.40 pesos.

The amount to be paid by the Pension Fund Administrator (AFP, for its acronym in Spanish) is equivalent to 2.87% of the employee's monthly salary. Its maximum is limited to $8,954.40 pesos.

Only apply for Income Tax (ISR, for its acronym in Spanish) those employees whose monthly salary, after having subtracted SFS and AFP, is more than $34,685.00 pesos.
